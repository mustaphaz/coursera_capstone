# # Week 4 part 2: Data

The sources that will be used:
- information about the postal codes and neighbourhoods in Toronto: [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M)
- information about all the venues in the different neighbourhoods will be retrieved from FourSquare

I will combine both sources into one dataset and then cluster all the neighbourhood based on the venues present.
After that I will select the top neighboorhood that have the most coffeeshops, public transport availability and 
restaurants.
